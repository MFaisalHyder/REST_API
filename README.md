# REST_API
Spring MVC REST API with :
	
	1) MongoDB for DataBase.
	
	2) Spring MVC4 FrameWork.  
	
	3) Gradle as dependency manager.
	
	4) Spring Boot for Rapid Development.
	
	5) Angular JS for data binding for Web App and making http calls to server.
	
	
Issue :

	1) Gradle Sync failed (on F5 / Refresh Gradle Project) gradle : with error 'You have provided wrong JDK HOME'
	=> go to X:\YourDirectory\WorkspacesName\REST_API\.settings\gradle
	In this file change project directory, gradle home and java home to ward off error of Gradle Sync.
